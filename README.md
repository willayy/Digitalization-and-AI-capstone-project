# Digitalization-and-AI-capstone-project
This is group 12's Chalmers X IKEA capstone project code repository containing our prototype software innovaton for IKEA.

## Running the software with the GUI

```shell
cd .../Digitalization-and-AI-capstone-project
# We recommend doing this in a virtual enviorment
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ImageGenInterface
# Launch the GUI, you would use python3 on an unix based system
python gui.py
```
## Usage
* Write your desired prompt, choose an image from your computer, click generate.
* The generation process will take some time (normally around / under 15 minutes but might take up to an hour depending on the hardware) and the window will be unresponsive while the image is being generated.
